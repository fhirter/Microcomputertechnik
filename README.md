# Microcomputertechnik
This Repo accompanies the lectures on "Mikrocomputertechnik" at Teko HÃ¶here Fachschule in Bern.
## Plattfomrs
Because different platforms are used solutions for exercises and examples can be found in different places:
- /Arduino: for everything that's platform independent but relies on the arduino libraries.
- /ARM_M0: everything that uses special features of the ARM Cortex M0 Microcontroller present in the supplied board "Arduino Nano 33 BLE"
- /AVR: same for the AVR Architecture Microcontroller present in the board "Arduino UNO"
